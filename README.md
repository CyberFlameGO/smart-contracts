# Smart Contracts

## Notes

* Cargo Workspace
* Anchor Workspace
* Migrate all contracts here
* Backwards compatiblity checks
* IDL generation for "non-anchor" contracts
* Forced commit/merge checks
* Test coverage - high threshold
* Contract - end to end testing

## Structure

* src
  * <name>
* anchor.yaml
