# Smart Contracts

The collection of [metaplex](https://metaplex.com) on-chain programs (aka smart contracts)

> Many programs currently reside in the [metaplex-foundation](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/rust) repository but most will be moving here.

### Programs

- [nft-packs](./nft-packs/README.md) - Allow creation of mystery packs of NFTs that are revealed after "opening"
- [metaplex-tests](./metaplex-tests/README.md) -  this repository's tests


In future we can use metaplex-tests crate to cover all the Metaplex programs with tests.

To run test go to metaplex-tests README and follow instructions.
