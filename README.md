# Smart Contracts

This repo contains smart contracts that are new, incubating or derivative of the main metaplex specification. The battle tested, specification contracts are stored and maintained by the Metaplex Foundation [metaplex-foundation](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/rust)

> Some of the programs living in [metaplex-foundation](https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/metaplex/tree/master/rust) will be moved here if they arent core to the metaplex protocol.

### Programs

- [nft-packs](./nft-packs/README.md) - Allow creation of mystery packs of NFTs that are revealed after "opening"
- [metaplex-tests](./metaplex-tests/README.md) -  this repository's tests


In future we can use metaplex-tests crate to cover all the Metaplex programs with tests.

To run test go to metaplex-tests README and follow instructions.
